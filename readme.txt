Plugin for easily adding a "Clip This" button to your WordPress site. For more information, see http://curate.us/plugins/wordpress

== Description ==

Adding the "Clip This" button gives your readers the ability to share your content across the web while giving you the ability to see how and where your content is used. When a reader creates a clip or formatted quote of your content, attribution to your original work is automatically added with links back to the source.  

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/curateus directory of your WordPress installation, and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

You need an account with http://curate.us. When you have signed up for an account, go to http://curate.us/my-curateus#mysites and enter your Site URL. Get your Host API key, paste that into the API key box on the Wordpress Curate.Us plugin settings page. From here, you can choose where the button appears, as well as which graphic is displayed.

If you are creating your own templates, add '<?php _e(clipButton()); ?> where you want the ``Clip This'' button to appear.
